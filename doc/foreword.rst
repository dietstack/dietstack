Foreword
========

All services runs in Docker_ containers and basic
deployment is done by simple bash script. There is no need to hassle with
config files, because these are generated by DietStack containers during
startup process. Simple deployment means that unlike other OpenStack distributions,
DietStack supports exactly one configuration based only on free linux software.
It means that it uses KVM (libvirt) as a hypervisor for Nova,
NFS for Cinder, VXLANS and linux bridges for Neutron networking.
To avoid dependencies as much as possible, it doesn't use standard distro packages to
deploy OpenStack service. Instead  docker containers are built directly from
upstream repositories. This makes DietStack independent from major linux distros.
HA configuration is not supported as it increases complexity significantly and
availability of small installations can be solved other way.

OpenStack services in DietStack
-------------------------------

- Keystone (Identity Management)
- Glance (Images)
- Nova (Compute)
- Neutron (Networking)
- Cinder (Block Storage)
- Heat (Orchestration)

OpenStack version
-----------------
Version 1 of DietStack was based on ``Newton`` version of OpenStack. Current version is version 2,
and is based on ``Pike``.

How DietStack can be used
-------------------------
Diestack is suitable for OpenStack training and learning purposes as well as for
small private cloud installations. At home I'm using it for all
my VMs like Git server, NAS Server, Torrent Downloader and more. I'm using it
also for development purposes and due to the fact OpenStack has built-in multitenancy,
I can have production and development VMs separated on a network level.

Scalability
-----------
DietStack is built to run OpenStack on cluster up to 10 nodes - 1 control
node and 9 compute nodes. It should be enough for most SOHO purposes.
Nevertheless technically there is no built-in limit in DietStack itself, so you can
try to deploy it on more nodes if you want.
